# Koray's latex homework style package

This is the style I use in my homeworks. Feel free to open a pull request. 

I'm still learning and honestly have no idea what I'm doing. This repo probably doesn't follow any latex package convensions.


```latex
% You need to include this package in your latex file.
\usepackage{./koray-tex-homework/homework.sty}
```
